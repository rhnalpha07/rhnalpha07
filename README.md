# 👋 Hi, I'm rhnalpha07!

I'm a **Computer Science student** who's currently learning **Python** for **Machine Learning** and also diving into **PHP & Laravel**. 😅

## 🔧 Skills
- 🐍 **Python**: Learning how to build an **AI** that can play tic tac. (But let’s be real, it probably won’t beat me. 😂)
- 💻 **PHP & Laravel**: Trying to build web apps, hoping I don't run into too many bugs. 😜
- 🧠 **Machine Learning**: Hoping to build a computer smarter than me someday. 😎

## 🎮 Hobbies
- 🎮 **Gaming**: When I play games, the real winner is always the *bot*... or is it? 😂
- 🎶 **Music**: Coding while listening to music, because who doesn’t need some jams to avoid going crazy? 😅

## 💡 Goals
- **Create a startup**: My dream is to build a successful startup, but I don’t want it to be a "sleeping startup." 😆
- **Keep Learning**: Because I believe there's no such thing as "too late" to learn something new! 😜
